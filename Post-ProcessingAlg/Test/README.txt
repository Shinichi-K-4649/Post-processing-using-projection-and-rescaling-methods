In this folder you will find several problems where you can test our post-processing algorithms.
In folder "problem_data", there are several small-sized instances selected from the SDPLIB [1].
Folder "InputSolution" contains the results of solving the problems in folder "problem_data" with some solvers.

Before using our programs, make sure that SeDuMi [2] is properly installed in your workspace.
(Our programs use some functions included in the SeDuMi package.)
